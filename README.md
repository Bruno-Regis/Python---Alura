## Conclusion
This game project was my first in object-oriented python training from Alura and it was pretty excited to me.
I discovered a new passion in last year wich was programming in python and this one was a great opportunity to start my journey here in GitHub begin my portfolio.
In addiction, i'm practicing my writing in English, I've written all the project code in english including comments and this read me.
